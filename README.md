A future goal for this project is to split it off into two separate projects, with one becoming a full-fledged game, and one similar to a modernized version of [NZ:P](https://github.com/nzp-team/nzportable) with mod tools. This is not the focus yet, but may become the focus once all mechanics are implemented and thouroughly polished.
